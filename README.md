## Tech Stack Used

-Next JS
Next js provides a simple and intuitive routing system that allows us to create dynamic and nested routes easily. It also makes deployment to popular hosting platforms much easier and supports various deployment strategies.

-TypeScript
TypeScript adds static typing to JavaScript, catching errors during development and providing better tooling support. Type annotations also serve as documentation, improving collaboration by making the codebase more understandable.

-React
React will enable us to build this application with reusable components, enhancing modularity, maintainability, and code organization. It also provides a vast ecosystem of libraries, tools, and community support, making it a strong choice for building scalable and feature-rich applications.

-Tailwind CSS
Tailwind CSS's utility-first approach allows us to build and style interfaces rapidly. Tailwind also facilitates responsive design by enabling us to build responsive designs with predefined classes for various screen sizes, enhancing responsive design.

## Project Implementations

-The project is based on REST using the Rick and Morty API (https://rickandmortyapi.com/)

-I decided to use Local Storage to store Persisted Notes about the specific characters. This is based on the following
reasons;
i). The Local Storage API is fast to implement, simple and easy to use.
ii). Local Storage provides a way to persistently store data on the client side.
iii). Data stored in Local Storage remains available even if we close the browser or navigate away from the page. It persists across different sessions.
iv). Local Storage operations are synchronous and provide fast read and write access to stored data.
